    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nI am collaborating with Columbia’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy (CPSP) for this final project. The CPSP now has a policy simulation tool, which enables user to choose different policy scenarios and explore the impact of the simulated policy on vulnerable communities. The impacts include change in different poverty measurements in general, change in specific demographic groups such as age and race, and change in different geographic regions (states).\nIn this four-week long project, I focused on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) scenarios, one of the most important federal programs supporting low-income households. The simulation tool has some visualizations to show the effect of different policy simulations, but the CPSP thinks that the visualizations they have now are difficult to interpret, lack of narrative structure, and do not effectively communicate key insights to broader audiences. My role is to make complex metrics such as poverty rates, income change, and people lifted out of poverty easier to interpret, and more engaging for advocates, policymakers, and researchers through redesigning these visualizations.\nThe reason why I chose to work with CPSP and helping them to improve visualizations is because I believe that data science is most useful when being applied to help the people in need. In this project, I hope that by making the visualizations of the policy simulations, I would be able to help the decision-makers understand the consequences of different policy choices, and how they could improve the lives of the targeted vulnerable communities.",

    "text": "1.2 Data\nMy primary responsibility in this project is to propose enhanced visualization strategies for the CPSP policy simulations. Because I do not have direct access to the full CPSP database, I compiled a custom dataset derived directly from the simulation tool’s output. To ensure consistency, I focused on a single policy scenario: the Low-Cost Food Plan using the Supplemental Poverty Measure, scoped to both National and California levels.\nThe source data consists of tabular outputs tracking metric variations across before policy, current policy, and post-simulation states. I consolidated these outputs into two distinct datasets with zero missing values.

This key insight is that the policy targets the middle tier more effectively than the extremes.\nI think this visualization shows the delta more effectively than the stacked bar chart because it has the same baseline and every metric starts at zero.

I don’t have the access to the real dataset right now, so I used this prototype to visualize the intersectional impact. I focused on children (the top beneficiary) here, and compare which children benefit most. This prototype demonstrates how specific factors such as living in rural area versus living in urban one, can drastically alter the policy’s impact on a child.",

She suggested that there could be a pie chart showing the composition of current poverty population for current policy scenario. This is the infographic to help the audience see the visual distribution of the four poverty metrics before the shift happened.\nThe supervisor validated the interactive demographic analysis as a key insight generator. While I am currently relying on a mock dataset, this approval confirms the methodology. The next step upon receiving full database access will be to replicate this code on the live microdata to generate the final intersectional reports.",

I moved from ineffective slope charts to Waterfall and Stacked Difference models, and proved that preserving baseline context is essential for interpreting magnitude. By isolating the reduction as a distinct visual element, I transformed subtle percentage-point shifts into tangible evidence of policy success. Additionally, the demographic ranking prototype established a scalable framework for equity analysis, proving that even with limited datasets, we can move from disjointed tables to a unified ranking system that instantly identifies the primary beneficiaries of legislative change.\nOne limitation is that this analysis currently relies on microdataset and mock dataset created by myself to prototype the visualization logic. While this establishes a working framework, the production-level CPSP database likely contains higher dimensionality and structural complexity. Consequently, the code will require validation and potential refactoring to accommodate the full scale of the real data.\nAnother limitation is that the current visualizations effectively capture static comparisons of the poverty metrics. However, they do not capture the dynamics of change. The next phase of development should introduce alluvial diagrams to tell the flow story, which not just visualizes the net reduction in poverty, but the specific pathways families take to exit it. This narrative depth is critical for helping policymakers iterate on and improve simulation parameters.",

The Near Poverty population is nearly double that of the standard Poverty group.

This key insight is that the policy targets the middle tier more effectively than the extremes.\nI think this visualization shows the delta more effectively than the stacked bar chart because it has the same baseline and every metric starts at zero.
